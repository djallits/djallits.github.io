### What I’m Responsible For

- Leading multi-team engineering organizations (30–60+ engineers) delivering mission-critical systems  
- Defining technical strategy and execution plans aligned to long-term business priorities  
- [Scaling teams](https://careers.bissell.com/), platforms, and processes in regulated and high-availability environments  
- Partnering closely with Product, Architecture, Security, and Operations at the portfolio level  

---

### Leadership Focus Areas

- **Engineering strategy & technical vision** — setting multi-year direction while enabling near-term execution  
- **Organizational design & talent** — building leadership depth, succession, and sustainable team structures  
- **Execution at scale** — predictable delivery across teams with complex dependencies  
- **Engineering excellence** — reliability, quality, security, and operational maturity  
- **Cross-functional leadership** — strong partnerships with product, design, and executive stakeholders

### Selected Impact Highlights

- Led platform and product teams supporting systems with **millions of users and high-availability requirements**  
- Modernized legacy architectures, contributing to **30–50% improvements in deployment frequency and lead time**  
- Established shared services and internal platforms adopted by **10+ teams**, reducing duplicated effort and operational risk

### Technical Perspective

My background is rooted in hands-on engineering, with a focus on systems that must operate reliably at scale.

I care deeply about:
- Clear ownership and accountability
- Overall developer experience

---

### Open Source & Public Work

This profile primarily reflects exploratory work and selective contributions.  Most of my professional impact comes from **enterprise platforms, internal tooling, and organizational leadership** rather than public repositories.

### What I Care About Building

- Teams that are accountable, curious, and resilient  
- Systems that are boring in production and easy to operate  
- Engineering cultures grounded in trust, clarity, and continuous improvement
