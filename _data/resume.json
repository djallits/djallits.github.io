During my time working with Dan, he was instrumental in streamlining and improving multiple software systems across the organization, as well as in driving cultural change in how people within the organization think about development and digital products. I would work with Dan again in a heartbeat."

When we hired Dan the company's technology team was still evolving - entering a phase of increased ownership for solutions that had been previously outsourced to providers with varying levels of adherence to software engineering practices. Dan quickly assessed the environment and the providers and began the process of introducing tools and techniques that allowed us to optimize our solution providers within the context of our broader technology strategy. Dan also distinguished himself as an advisor to internal product stakeholders at all levels of the organization - demonstrating a \"business first\" sensibility by posing questions that reflected an understanding of the intersection of technology, business needs and the digital ecosystem that often informs the success of feature enhancements or new products. These attributes and Dan's forthright manner helped him establish a close-knit, high-performing team that were obviously committed to supporting their leader."

As the Product lead, I had great appreciation for Dan's enthusiasm for working with multiple internal and external teams to take care of the thousand and one details that need to happen to get it done. On top of his technical and operational knowledge of the WordPress backend, the \"extra\" you get with Dan is his dedication to really taking the time to learn about the business and eagerness to brainstorm ideas for how to move the business forward. I highly recommend Dan for any company that is looking for someone who brings technical, operational, and business know-how, along with a can-do attitude to the table."
